			<h3 > Professional </h3>
			<p> I am a junior attending the University of St. Thomas. For my major studies, I am focused on Actuarial Science, with minors in Statistcs, Mathematics and Computer Programing. I currently work at the KNW Group, an insurance brokerage specializing in employee benefits, as a benefits anaylst. I have hopes of being transfered to the Actuarial team soon. In terms of professional goals, I hope to complete the actuarial exams until fellowship in the SOA. I would like to have a job in the field of health care, specifically at Optum as a part of the Actuary department.

			<h3> Personal </h3>
		 	<p> 	In my free time I enjoy spending time on the golf course, continuing working of the progress made in my four years of high school golf. My entire family golfs, and the best rounds are spent with my dad and two little brothers, ages 14 and 10. 
		 	</p>
		 	<br>
		 	<p>	In terms of my characteristics, I would call myself friendly, polite, focused and determined. I know what my goal are, and am willing to make sacrifices in order to achieve them. My favorite classes in college so far have been Object Oriented Design, CISC 230, and multivariable calculus.
